/*
Type conversion
There are multiple functions for conversion:
- Number()
- String()
- And, Boolean()

Simply put the variable or value inside the bracket
, aka passing in an argument. 

for instance,
let word = 'joe';
Boolean(word);
console.log(joe, typeof joe);

This will print out '1, boolean' in the console log. 

Note:
for boolean, as long as the passing variable/value isn't
null, when converting the value to boolean, it should return 1.
